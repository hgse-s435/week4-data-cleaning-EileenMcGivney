      "future work.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.1 significance of main findings\n",
      "we have three main findings. first, we demonstrated that a\n",
      "machine-learned mind wandering detector built in one context\n",
      "can be applied to a different (albeit related) interaction context.\n",
      "specifically, the detector was trained on a data set involving\n",
      "participants silently reading and self-reporting mind wandering,\n",
      "but was applied to an interactive context involving interpolated\n",
      "assessments, which engendered different reading strategies.\n",
      "further, self-reports of mind wandering were not collected in this\n",
      "interactive context, which might have influenced mind wandering\n",
      "rates in and of itself. despite these differences, we were able to\n",
      "demonstrate the predictive validity of the detector by showing\n",
      "that it negatively correlated with both online and offline\n",
      "comprehension scores when evaluated on new participants.\n",
      "second, we showed promising effects for our intervention\n",
      "approach despite a very conservative experimental design, which\n",
      "ensured that the intervention and control groups were equated\n",
      "along all respects, except that the intervention was triggered based\n",
      "on the mind wandering detector (key manipulation). further, we\n",
      "used a probabilistic approach to trigger an intervention, because\n",
      "the detector is inherently imperfect. as a result, participants could\n",
      "have received an intervention when they were not mind\n",
      "wandering and/or could have failed to receive one when they were\n",
      "mind wandering. therefore, it was essential to compare the two\n",
      "groups under conditions when the mind wandering levels\n",
      "differed. this more nuanced analysis revealed that although the\n",
      "intervention itself did not lead to a boost in overall comprehension\n",
      "(because it is remedial), it equated comprehension scores when\n",
      "mind wandering was high (i.e., scores for the intervention group\n",
      "were comparable when the control group was low on mind\n",
      "wandering). it also demonstrated the cost of not intervening\n",
      "during mind wandering (i.e., scores for the intervention group\n",
      "were greater when the control group was high on mind\n",
      "wandering). in other words, the intervention was successful in\n",
      "mitigating the negative effects of mind wandering.\n",
      "third, despite the advantages articulated above, the intervention\n",
      "itself was reactive and engendered several unintended (and\n",
      "presumably suboptimal) behaviors. in particular, students altered\n",
      "their reading strategies in response to the interpolated questions,\n",
      "which were a critical part of the intervention. in a sense, they\n",
      "attempted to “game the intervention” by attempting to proactively\n",
      "predict the types of questions they might receive and then\n",
      "adopting a complementary reading strategy consisting of\n",
      "skimming and/or focusing on factual information. this reliance\n",
      "on surface- rather than deeper-levels of processing was\n",
      "incongruent with our goal of promoting deep comprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.2 limitations\n",
      "there are a number of methodological limitations with this work\n",
      "that go beyond limitations with the intervention (as discussed\n",
      "above). first, we focused on a single text that is perceived as\n",
      "being quite dull and consequently triggers rather high levels of\n",
      "mind wandering [26]. this raises the question of whether the\n",
      "detector will generalize to different texts. we expect some level\n",
      "of generalizability in terms of features used because the detector\n",
      "only used content- and position- (on the screen) free global gaze\n",
      "features. however, given that several supervised classifiers are\n",
      "very sensitive to differences in base rates, the detector might overor under- predict mind wandering when applied to texts that\n",
      "engender different rates of mind wandering. therefore, retraining\n",
      "the detector with a more diverse set of texts is warranted.\n",
      "another limitation is the scalability of our learning technology.\n",
      "the eye tracker we used was a cost-prohibitive tobii tx300 that\n",
      "will not scale beyond the laboratory. fortunately, commercialoff-the-shelf (cots) eye trackers, such as eye tribe and tobii\n",
      "eyex, can be used to surpass this limitation. it is an open question\n",
      "as to whether the mind wandering detector can operate with\n",
      "similar fidelity with these cots eye trackers. our use of global\n",
      "gaze features which do not require high-precision eye tracking\n",
      "holds considerable promise in this regard. nevertheless,\n",
      "replication with scalable eye trackers and/or scalable alternatives\n",
      "to eye tracking (e.g., facial-feature tracking [46] or monitoring\n",
      "reading patterns [27]) is an important next step (see section 5.3).\n",
      "our use of surface-level questions for both the intervention and\n",
      "the subsequent comprehension assessment is also a limitation as\n",
      "is the lack of a delayed comprehension assessment. it might be\n",
      "the case that the intervention effects manifest as richer encodings\n",
      "in long-term memory, a possibility that cannot be addressed in the\n",
      "current experiment that only assessed immediate learning.\n",
