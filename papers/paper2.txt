system called gurututor [30]. this project also addresses some
of the scalability concerns by replacing expensive research-grade
eye tracking with cost-effective cots eye tracking (e.g., the eye
tribe or tobii eyex) and provides evidence for real-world
generalizability by collecting data in classrooms rather than the
lab. we recently tested our implementation on 135 students (total)
in a noisy computer-enabled high-school classroom where eyegaze of entire classes of students was collected during their
normal class periods [20]. using a similar approach to the present
work, we used the data to build and validate a studentindependent gaze-based mind wandering detector. the resultant
mind wandering detection accuracy (f1 of 0.59) was substantially
greater than chance (f1 of 0.24) and outperformed earlier work on
the same domain [21]. the next step is to develop interventions
that redirect attention and correct learning deficiencies
attributable to mind wandering and to test the interventions in
real-world environments. by doing so, we hope to advance our
foundational vision of developing next-generation technologies
that enhance the process and products of learning by “attending
to attention.”
